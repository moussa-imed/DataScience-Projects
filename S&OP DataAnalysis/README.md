This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of stock returns using various data analysis techniques. The objective is to gain insights into the relationships and patterns among different stocks. The project includes steps such as data cleaning, visualization, clustering, factor analysis, and principal component analysis. Through these techniques, we explore the variability in stock returns, identify groups of stocks with similar behavior, extract underlying factors, and visualize the data in lower-dimensional spaces. The project's findings contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics and interdependencies within the stock market. The code and analysis can be found in the provided ipynb file, offering a comprehensive overview of the project's methodologies and results.
